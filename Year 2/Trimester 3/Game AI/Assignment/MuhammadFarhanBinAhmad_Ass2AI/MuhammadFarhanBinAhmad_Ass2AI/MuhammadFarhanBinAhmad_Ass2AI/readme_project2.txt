My experience working on this project:
Painful. It sound simple in theory but in execution it was not. Maybe i'm dumb or careless but I felt that I could have done it quicker
if it weren't for my supidity. But whats done is done.
Fun fact - I redid this project 3 times.

Hours spent:
30 hours

Extra credits:
Nil

Note:
For smoothing, im not sure if we suppose to fix the issue when the path list size is less than 4 but i added a if statement that check
the list size first. If fail, then the smoothing will be applied.
Can get extra credit for this? :)
