the choice of a storage medium and format for persistent resources usually has
far reaching consequences on both the design and the ergonomy of an application
If we have formally expressed requirements that favor one medium or format over
all others we will let those dictate our choice however there are situations in 
which the functionality we are implementing demands some form of persistent storage
but no particular choice of medium or format seems to be particularly appropriate
