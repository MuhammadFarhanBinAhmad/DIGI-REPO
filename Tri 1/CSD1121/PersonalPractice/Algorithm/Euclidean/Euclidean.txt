The highest divisible value of 2 values
eg:
Let A = 1785
Let B = 546

The highest divisible value is 21

How is 21 achieve?

1786/546 = 3 R 147
546/147 = 3 R 105
147/105 = 1 R 42
105/42 = 2 R 21
42/21 = 2 R 0

Once the remainder value is 0, the equation stop and the last non zero remainder number is the highest possible divisible value
