Formula for the Fibonacci sequence F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2)
Fibonacci sequence is a series of number when a sum of a value is the value of 2 sum before it add together
eg:
0+1 =1
1+1 =2
1+2 =3
2+3 =5
3+5 =8
5+8 =13
....
Its use and seen almost everyone as its better known as the Golden ration(JOJO REFERENCE)
The golden ratio is 1:1.6 and that can be achive by taking sum of the 2 sum and dividing it first value.
Example:
Let A = 3
Let B = 2
when the sum of A+B is divided by the sum of A, the value will be 1.6(Golden ratio)

Whats a Golden ratio?
Represented by φ(phi), its also called the Divine proporion due to how its seen and use in almost everything
Nature,building arts etc.
In geometry:
When applied as a growth factor, you will get a special type of spiral known as a golden spiral
The golden spiral is when every quarter turn it makes, it grows by the value of φ(phi) which is 1.6
