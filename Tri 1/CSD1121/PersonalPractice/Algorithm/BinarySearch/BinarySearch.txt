DIVIDE AND CONQUER

Finding the desired value via splitting the array in half and comparing the middle value with the desired value
eg.
int array[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
int desired_value = 7

Splitting the array in half, the desired_value will be compared to array[3](4)
If the value is too high,it will discard that value and all the value above it
If too low, then it will discard that value and all value below
In this case, the value is too low, thus, discarding it and all the array below it
After which, the array is split again and the value is compared again with the middle array value. Hence repeat

Reason for use:
A more optimize way of finding a desired value in the list if one does not how where the 
desired value is placed in the array rather than going through the entire array in a linear fashion
